# Calculator

## Resources Used
I refered to api.flutter.dev for the specifications and syntax of the widgets. For instance, I went to the flutter website to understand part 1 of the spec by reading about the ElevatedButton class. The spec says the class has Text and Icon children and once I saw the documentation, I understood what the spec was referring to.


### New Learnings
A technique I learned was ensuring that I am closing each open paranthesis and bracket. When there are a lot, it's difficult to know which bracket is according to which, 
so I have to count the number of open brackets there are. However, dart gives me comments for each closing bracket so it helped me count. 

## Challenges
A challenge was figuring out how to test my code. Initially, I thought I will have to test on Xcode. However, Xcode required the signing and authenciation which 
I couldn't get pass because it says my device simulator cannot run. I seeked alternatives to XCode and found that just running chrome on VSCode shows me the immediate result of my code. 
I can quickly see what I did wrong. 

### Mistakes 
A mistake I did was debugging my code errors really late. I made the mistake to code most of the functions before running my solution. As a result, there were too many bugs that 
I had to git clone a fresh copy. I learned that I should constantly run the app and debug each error in my code so it doesn't become a headache later on.
